1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

AI is the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, like problem-solving, decision-making, understanding language, or recognizing patterns.

2. What are Large Language Models (LLMs)? How do they work?

LLMs are AI models trained on massive amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language. They work by predicting the next word in a sequence using deep learning techniques, mainly the Transformer architecture.

3. What is the difference between Traditional AI and Generative AI?

Traditional AI is mostly rule-based and focused on specific tasks like classification or predictions. Generative AI, on the other hand, can actually create new content such as text, images, or even music.

4. Explain the concept of “prompting” in the context of LLMs. Why is it important?

Prompting means giving instructions or input to a language model. It’s important because the way you frame the prompt directly affects the quality, style, and accuracy of the model’s response.

5. What is the role of "tokens" in a language model, and how do they impact the output?

Tokens are the chunks of text (like words or parts of words) that a model processes. The number of tokens affects how much context the model can handle and how long or detailed the output can be.

6. What are some limitations or risks of using Generative AI models like ChatGPT?

Generative AI can sometimes give wrong information, show bias, or “hallucinate.” There are also risks like misuse for misinformation, over-reliance without fact-checking, and concerns about privacy and ethics.

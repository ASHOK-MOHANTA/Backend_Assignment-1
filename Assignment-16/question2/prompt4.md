# Role-Based — Personal Finance Advisor  

## Prompt  
Act as a financial advisor. I want to buy a car in 2 years worth ₹8 lakhs. I can save ₹20,000 per month. Suggest me a savings plan.  

## Response (AI Generated)  
- Monthly savings: ₹20,000 → 24 months = ₹4,80,000  
- Invest in recurring deposit or SIP (approx 10% returns).  
- Projected value after 2 years ≈ ₹5.3–5.5 lakhs.  
- Gap to ₹8 lakhs → use part-time income or increase savings by ₹5k/month.  
- Stick to budget, avoid unnecessary debt.
